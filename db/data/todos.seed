Drink some water
Eat something if you haven't in the last three hours
Take a shower
If daytime: put something fun on
If nighttime: turn all your screens off and rest for 15 minutes
Take a walk somewhere
Dance or jog to some music
Say a genuine, nice thing to someone
Get something small completed
You are stronger than you think
